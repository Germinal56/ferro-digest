Studies examining PSU and its impact among adults remain limited. Hence, we aim to examine the prevalence of PSU among adults in Singapore, and explore its associations with smartphone activities, sleep quality, and psychological well-being, as well as age and gender-related differences in these associations. A household survey (n = 1200) was conducted among multi-ethnic Singapore adults aged 21 to 60. The survey employed a proportionate stratified random sampling approach. The Smartphone Addiction Scale–Short Version was used to determine risk of PSU. Adjusted multivariable logistic regressions, age-stratified (21–30, and above 30) analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed. The survey response rate was 45.7%. PSU prevalence rate was estimated to be 34.0%. Adults at risk were younger (OR = 3.72, p < 0.001), had poor sleep quality (OR = 2.94), reported depressive (OR = 2.84, p = 0.001) or anxiety symptoms (OR = 2.44, p < 0.001), tend to use smartphones for social media (OR = 2.81, p = 0.002) or entertainment (OR = 2.72, p < 0.001). Protective factors include higher levels of social support (OR = 0.76, p = 0.007), using smartphones for calling family (OR = 0.39, p = 0.003) and friends (OR = 0.53, p = 0.030), and spending four hours or less of smartphone usage duration (OR = 0.40, p < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings. Associations between PSU and poor sleep quality (OR = 3.72, p < 0.001), depressive (OR = 3.83, p < 0.001), and anxiety symptoms (OR = 2.59, p = 0.004) and social media usage (OR = 3.46, p < 0.001) were more pronounced in adults over 30. PSU was more prevalent among females in those aged 21–30 (OR = 2.60, p = 0.022). Social support appears to be a protective factor for adults over 30 (OR = 0.64, p < 0.001) but was not observed in those aged 21–30. Among males, younger age (21–30 years), poor sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms, and using social media and entertainment apps were significantly associated with PSU. Females showed similar associations. Social support appears to be a protective factor for females (OR = 0.70, p = 0.018), but this association was not observed for males. Shorter smartphone usage times were inversely associated with PSU in both genders. A substantial proportion of adults exhibited PSU. Findings highlight the differential associations between PSU and psychological well-being, social support, interactions with technology, and sleep quality. These associations are influenced by age which has implications for preventive efforts. Citation: Ong RHS, Sim HS, Bergman MM, How CH, Png CAL, Lim CS, et al.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Smartphones are widely used and have revolutionized the way we communicate, work, shop, learn, and interact with others [1, 2]. Despite numerous benefits, research has identified negative consequences related to excessive smartphone use [3–6] and proposed constructs such as \"smartphone addiction\" and \"problematic smartphone use\" [7–9]. Excessive smartphone use shares symptomatic similarities with behavioural addictions, including salience, mood changes, tolerance, withdrawal, and conflict [10–12]. No diagnostic criteria for smartphone addiction exist to date, although ongoing efforts are addressing this gap [13]. In this study, we employ Problematic Smartphone Use (PSU) in line with recommendations [14] and is defined as: \"An inability to regulate one’s use of the mobile phone, which eventually involves negative consequences in daily life\" [15]. Psychosocial factors play an important role in the development of PSU. For instance, emotional dysregulation, and the ’fear of missing out’ (FoMO) have been associated with increased vulnerability to PSU as individuals turn to smartphones to manage their negative emotions [16] or engage excessively online to stay socially connected or updated [17]. Gender differences have also been observed, with studies suggesting that females may be at greater risk of PSU due to higher stress levels, anxiety, and higher engagement with social apps. Research suggests that both process-related (e.g. consumption of news, entertainment) and social-related (e.g. social networking, messaging) smartphone use can contribute to the development of PSU. However, it remains unclear which type of use is most strongly associated with PSU [18–20]. Additionally, researchers have observed that females engage with smartphones more frequently for social purposes and experience higher social stress, which could increase their risk of problematic smartphone behaviour [20, 21]. Given the psychological challenges associated with excessive smartphone use, recent studies have explored the potential role of psychological resilience. Resilience has been shown to mediate or moderate the relationship between poor sleep quality, FoMO, mental health, and stress and PSU, potentially acting as a protective factor against PSU [22–24]. Beyond resilience, individual differences, such as personality traits, also play a significant role in susceptibility to PSU. Several studies have found connections between the Big Five personality traits and PSU. Neuroticism correlates positively with PSU, partly due the need to seek reaffirmation for social acceptance and belonging through social media apps [25, 26]. In contrast, conscientiousness has a negative association with PSU, reflecting findings that links low self-regulation to addictive tendencies [26–28]. Extraversion, however, appears unrelated to PSU [26, 29]. Research on PSU has predominantly focused on children and adolescents [16–18], contending that this demographic is particularly vulnerable to sleep disturbances, social dysfunction, academic underperformance, stress, and mental health symptoms [3–6, 19, 20]. However, researchers have emphasised the importance of including adults in PSU research to gain a more comprehensive understanding of PSU [30]. Studies conducted among adults in Spain, Lebanon, and Germany have reported a PSU prevalence of 20.5%, 20.2%, and 20.6%, respectively [31–33], while studies in Hong Kong [34] and Tianjin [35] reported an elevated 39% and 52%, respectively. Research on adults have identified adverse consequences in adulthood [36], such as anxiety, depression, and lower mental well-being among Hong Kong Chinese adults aged 18 years and above [37]. Similarly, associations were observed between PSU and younger age groups, females, prolonged daily smartphone usage, elevated stress, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances among German adults aged 16 through 65 [33]. PSU impact on sleep quality has been associated with bedtime procrastination [38, 39]. Zhang and Wu [38] found that bedtime procrastination mediates the relationship between problematic smartphone use and poor sleep quality. They suggest that high levels of smartphone engagement at bedtime, coupled with the reluctance to disengage from activities on smartphones, lead to delays in sleep onset, ultimately resulting in poorer sleep quality and shorter sleep duration. Despite advancements in PSU research, studies on adult populations, particularly across different age groups, remain limited. Neugarten’s theory of adult development posits that, throughout the human lifespan, societal expectations shapes individuals’ engagement in activities, behaviours, and milestones that are specific to their age groups [40]. Given the variation in lifestyles, family environment and behaviours across ages and its influence on smartphone usage [41], it is crucial to consider the influence of age on PSU. While prior research have examined age-related variations in line with the ’components model of addictions’ [11], there remains a limited body of literature on age-related variations in the prevalence of PSU or its associated factors within a multi-ethnic adult population. Our study addresses this gap by exploring PSU among adults in Singapore—a multi-ethnic, urbanised city-state with one of the world’s highest smartphone usage rates, where 97% of the population in 2021 were smartphone users [42]. Specifically, we aim to assess the prevalence of PSU among adults in Singapore, and explore its associations with smartphone activities, sleep quality and psychological well-being, and potential age and gender-related differences in these associations. A cross-sectional household survey was conducted from October to November 2022, targeting Singaporean citizens and permanent residents aged 21 through 60 who owned a smartphone and were proficient in English, Mandarin, or Malay. The recruitment period spanned from October 19, 2022, when the first participant was recruited, to November 26, 2022, when the last participant was recruited. The study sample was drawn from the eastern region of Singapore, with an approximate population of 426,000 residents [43]. The primary outcome, PSU, was evaluated with the Smartphone Addiction Scale–Short Version (SAS-SV) [44]. Suitable reliability and validity measures were reported on this ten-item self-report scale across diverse adult populations, including different cultural backgrounds [34, 45, 46]. The SAS-SV encompassed five domains: daily-life disturbance, withdrawal, cyberspace-oriented relationships, overuse, and tolerance [44]. Responses are measured on a 1–6 ordinal scale, yielding total scores between 10 and 60. Higher scores indicated increased severity of PSU. In accordance with [44], we adopted at risk of PSU cut-off values of 31 for males and 33 for females. Sleep quality and psychological well-being measurements The 19-item Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) includes seven domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction. Responses and scored on a 0–3 ordinal scale, and the global score ranges between 0 and 21. A global score greater than 5 indicates poor sleep quality [47, 48]. The nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) gauges depressive symptom severity [49], while the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) assesses generalized anxiety disorder symptoms [50]. Responses range between 0 (not at all) and 3 (nearly every day). Symptom severity is assessed as minimal (0–4), mild (5–9), moderate (10–14), or severe (≥ 15). Both instruments exhibited strong reliability and validity across diverse populations and settings [51]. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), a 10-item scale ranging from 0 (never) and 4 (very often), assesses subjective perceptions of stress. Total scores range between 0 and 40 [52]. The 12-item Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) assesses perceptions of social support [53]. Responses range between 1 to 7, where higher average scores signify higher perceived social support [54]. Sociodemographic and lifestyle measurements Sociodemographic data included age, gender, ethnicity, education, marital status, profession, housing type, personal monthly income, and residential area (S1 File), while lifestyle data included tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine consumption in the past 12 months. Physical activity levels were assessed by the validated and widely employed International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) Short Form on physical activity across various domains, including leisure, work-related, and transportation-related activities, as well as household chores [55]. Smartphone activities questions were adapted from a previous study [4] and included time spent on smartphones, and smartphone activities (S2 File). Smartphone time usage data was recoded into three groups: \"< 2 hours,\" \"2–4 hours,\" and \"> 4 hours\". Household data collection was facilitated by a survey company in collaboration with the first author, who oversaw the training of data collectors. When available, validated translated instruments were employed; otherwise, the survey company utilized back translation [56] between English, Mandarin, and Malay. To boost response rates, notification letters informed residents in advance about the purpose and scheduling of the survey, and participants received a SGD$30 voucher. It took between 20 to 30 minutes to complete the survey, and data collectors made up to three attempts to reach households. Sample size calculation and sampling procedures. Sample size calculation was based on estimates by [34], based on which the Singapore Department of Statistics (SingStat) calculated an estimated sample size of 400, assuming prevalence of 39% at a 95% CI. To address non-response rates, we considered Singapore’s household survey figures, which reported rates of at least 50%, depending on wave [57, 58]. We therefore estimated a non-response rate of 65%, resulting in a rounded estimate of 1200 households to be surveyed. Households were selected based on a proportionate stratified random design by dwelling type (public flats, condominiums, and landed properties). From each selected household, one eligible individual was randomly chosen. The survey response rate was determined by dividing the number of completed surveys by the number of eligible cases (the individuals successfully identified at their households, excluding ineligible cases) and expressing this value as a percentage [59]. Significant components identified in preliminary analyses were integrated into multivariable logistic regression models, adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, and residential area. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% CIs were reported where appropriate. Given the absence of clinically validated cut-off scores for classifying PSU with the SAS-SV, a sensitivity analysis was conducted by treating SAS-SV scores as a continuous outcome, allowing examination of potential influences of SAS-SV cut-offs on observed effects. Exploratory, age-stratified, and gender-stratified analyses were performed to determine if the associated factors of PSU varied across age groups and gender. All analyses were conducted with SPSS software version 27.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA). The study procedures were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board (CIRB Ref. No.: 2022/2123) approved the study. All participants were informed about the study, oral consent was obtained and documented in the study records, and a waiver of written informed consent documentation was granted by the ethics board based on ethical considerations. The overall survey response rate was 45.7%. Out of 875 eligible households, 400 successfully completed the survey. The characteristics of our sample is summarised in Table 1. The distribution of respondents’ age, gender, ethnicity, and marital status is similar to Singapore’s population census data (S1 Table). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315364.t001 The SAS-SV mean score was 27.8 (SD = 9.9). 136 individuals met the cut-off for PSU, indicating an estimated prevalence of 34.0%, (95% CI 29.4, 38.7). By gender, the prevalence of PSU was 29.5% in males, (95% CI 22.8 to 36.2) and 38.5% in females, (95% CI 31.8 to 45.2). Regarding age groups, the prevalence of PSU was 51.4% (n = 54) among respondents aged 21 through 30, (95% CI 41.3 to 61.6), 27.6% (n = 24) for 31 through 40, (95% CI 17.1 to 38.1), 33.7% (n = 31) for 41 through 50, (95% CI 22.5 to 44.9), and 23.3% (n = 27) for those aged 51 through 60, (95% CI 13.9 to 32.7). Associations of sociodemographic and lifestyle variables with PSU Younger age and unmarried status were significantly associated with PSU (Table 2). Due to collinearity between marital status and age, marital status was excluded in subsequent multivariable logistic regression models. In the adjusted multivariable regression analyses (Table 3), significantly higher odds of PSU were observed for those aged 21 through 30 (OR = 3.72, 95% CI 2.06 to 6.74), p < 0.001) when compared to those aged 51 through 60. Variables associated with problematic smartphone use. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315364.t002 Adjusted multivariable logistic regression of factors associated with problematic smartphone use. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315364.t003 Associations of sleep quality and psychological well-being with PSU Significant associations were observed between PSU and poor sleep quality, self-reported symptoms of depression, and anxiety. Higher social support scores were associated with non-PSU respondents (Table 2). In adjusted multivariable analyses (Table 3), respondents with depressive symptoms had significantly higher odds of PSU compared to those reporting no or minimal symptoms (OR = 2.84, 95% CI 1.61 to 5.02, p = 0.001). Similarly, respondents with anxiety symptoms exhibited significantly higher odds of PSU (OR = 2.44, 95% CI 1.44 to 4.15, p < 0.001). The analyses also revealed higher odds of PSU in respondents experiencing poor sleep quality (OR = 3.10, 95% CI 1.85 to 5.21, p < 0.001). In contrast, higher levels of perceived social support were negatively associated with PSU (OR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.93, p = 0.007). Associations of smartphone activities with PSU Significant associations also exist between PSU and specific smartphone activities, including calling family or friends, accessing social media, listening to music, and video/entertainment apps, and the amount of time on smartphone (Table 2). Multivariable analyses revealed that social media users have significantly higher odds of PSU, compared to non-users (OR = 2.81, 95% CI 1.45 to 5.44, p = 0.002; Table 3), as does video/entertainment usage (OR = 2.76, 95% CI 1.63 to 4.65, p < 0.001). In contrast, respondents using smartphones to make calls to family or friends had lower odds of PSU, compared to non-callers (calling family: OR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.73, p = 0.003; calling friends: OR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.94, p = 0.030). Individuals spending four hours or less daily on smartphones exhibited lower odds of PSU, compared to those using smartphones for more than four hours (two to four hours: OR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.66, p < 0.001; less than two hours: OR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.67, p = 0.001). A sensitivity analysis employing Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV) as a continuous outcome variable yielded consistent findings with the primary analyses (S2 Table), which suggests that associations with PSU were not significantly influenced by the SAS-SV cut-off scores. Given the significant prevalence of PSU among individuals aged 21 through 30, age-stratified analyses were performed to compare this age group with those aged over 30 (Table 4). Adjusted multivariable logistic regression models in the 21–30 age bracket (n = 105) showed significant positive associations with PSU for being female (OR = 2.60, 95% CI 1.15 to 5.88, p = 0.022) and the use of smartphone video/entertainment apps (OR = 6.03, 95% CI 1.58 to 22.95, p < 0.003). In the aged 30 and above cohort (n = 295), significant associations with PSU included poor sleep quality (OR = 3.72, 95% CI 2.01 to 6.87, p < 0.001), depressive symptoms (OR = 3.83, 95% CI 1.95 to 7.49, p < 0.001), anxiety symptoms (OR = 2.59, 95% CI 1.36 to 4.90, p = 0.004), browsing social media (OR = 3.46, 95% CI 1.66 to 7.21, p < 0.001) or video/entertainment apps (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.94, p = 0.006). Conversely, smartphone use for calling family (OR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.83, p = 0.014) and friends (OR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.86, p = 0.015), using smartphones for four hours or less daily (two to four hours: OR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.43, p< 0.001; less than two hours: OR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.45, p < 0.001), as well as higher levels of perceived social support (OR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.81, p < 0.001) were negatively associated with PSU in participants aged 30 and above. Age-stratified adjusted multivariable logistic regression models. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315364.t004 Given the established evidence in the literature pointing to gender differences in PSU, we conducted an exploratory analysis to investigate this further. Our age-stratified analysis additionally revealed gender-based variations in PSU prevalence, supporting the association between gender and PSU. Gender-stratified logistic regression analyses were performed, with adjustments for age, ethnicity, and residential area (Table 5). Among males, those aged 21–30 years had significantly higher odds of PSU compared to those aged 51–60 years (OR = 3.27, 95% CI 1.30 to 8.22, p = 0.012). For females, individuals aged 21–30 years exhibited significantly higher odds of PSU (OR = 4.97, 95% CI 2.16 to 11.45, p < 0.001). Poor sleep quality was significantly associated with increased odds of PSU in both males (OR = 3.15, 95% CI 1.46 to 6.81, p = 0.003) and females (OR = 3.04, 95% CI 1.51 to 6.15, p = 0.002). Depressive symptoms were associated with higher odds of PSU for both genders, with an adjusted OR of 4.23, 95% CI [1.72, 10.44], p = 0.002 for males, and adjusted OR of 2.15, 95% CI [1.03, 4.49], p = 0.041 for females. Anxiety symptoms were also significantly associated with PSU, with an adjusted OR of 3.04, 95% CI [1.29, 7.15], p = 0.011 for males, and adjusted OR of 2.06, 95% CI [1.04, 4.10], p = 0.038 for females. Gender-stratified adjusted multivariable logistic regression models. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315364.t005 Social media use was positively associated with PSU in males (OR = 2.77, 95% CI 1.11 to 6.94, p = 0.030) and females (OR = 2.62, 95% CI 1.03 to 6.67, p = 0.044). Watching videos or entertainment apps was also associated with higher odds of PSU in males (OR = 2.15, 95% CI 1.03 to 4.49, p = 0.042) and females (OR = 3.91, 95% CI 1.83 to 8.34, p < 0.001). Conversely, calling friends was associated with lower odds of PSU among males (OR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.87, p = 0.022) but not among females (p = 0.748). Smartphone usage of 2–4 hours per day was associated with lower odds of PSU relative to usage over 4 hours per day for males (OR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.89, p = 0.024) and females (OR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.73, p = 0.004). Among females, less than 2 hours of daily usage was also associated with significantly lower odds of PSU (OR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.69, p = 0.007). Higher perceived social support was associated with reduced odds of PSU in females (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.94, p = 0.018), although this association did not reach significance in males (p = 0.071). The PSU prevalence of 34% among Singaporean adult residents surpasses the rates in Spain, Lebanon, and Germany [31–33], yet fall below Hong Kong and Tianjin [34, 60]. These variations may be due in part to cultural differences, as has also been proposed by [61] in a cross-cultural mixed methods study, where Chinese university students had significantly higher rates of PSU, compared to their British counterparts. Our findings reveal a positive association between PSU and engagement with social media, in contrast to protective effects associated with social networking, such as phoning family and friends. This finding clearly points at the differential effects of smartphone use, depending on the nuanced ways individuals interact with technology. In this sense, positive and meaningful interactions with significant others via smartphones may either bypass or alleviate PSU. Research indeed indicates that messaging and digital connections, for example, are less likely associated with PSU [18]. Consistent with prior research among children and adolescents [11], our study reinforced the observation that younger individuals across gender in our diverse, multi-ethnic adult sample exhibited a heightened susceptibility to PSU, with results suggesting that females in the 21–30 age group displayed greater susceptibility compared to males. The observed age-related vulnerability may be linked to the type and degree of smartphone engagement among younger adults [62], which may render younger individuals more susceptible to gratification and reinforcement patterns and thus contribute to PSU [63]. Age-related difference could be associated with developmental and societal norms. The gender difference observed in the 21–30 age group is consistent with previous studies [64]. However, this gender difference was not present in the 30 and above group. The reason for this lack of gender difference in older age groups remains unclear and warrants further investigation. Contrary to expectations and the reported 4.3% prevalence in the literature, [11], older individuals in our study exhibited a substantial PSU prevalence of 23%. This highlights the importance of intervention strategies that address diverse age groups, motivations, and needs. If PSU is viewed as stemming from underlying issues like loneliness and social isolation, interventions should target those specific needs. Looking beyond individual therapies like motivation enhancement and cognitive behavioural therapy [65], therapies that involve patients and their social setting to manage PSU may include family and couple therapy [66, 67]. Furthermore, practical psychosocial interventions can be beneficial, which may include participation in community activities, courses, group exercises, and support groups [68]. For elderly, especially less mobile patients or those experiencing age-related stressors such as caregiver burden or \"empty nest” symptoms [69], community nursing or other care programs may effectively mitigate PSU [70]. Our findings also indicated that the associations between PSU, increased smartphone usage, and symptoms of poor mental well-being such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances are also present in our adult sample among those aged 21 through 60, in both genders. Evidence suggests that excessive smartphone use, especially before bedtime, is linked to decreased sleep efficiency, poorer sleep quality, and delayed bedtime [71, 72]. Prospective longitudinal studies have also revealed the possibility of a bidirectional association between PSU, sleep quality and mental health symptoms, suggesting complex reciprocities [72–74]. The absence of a significant association between poor sleep quality and PSU among ages 21 to 30 is consistent with a prior study [75]. However, we observed a departure from this trend among participants older than 30, where significant associations were found between poor sleep quality, mental health symptoms, and PSU. The relationship between PSU, age-related mental health symptoms, and sleep quality is complex, and this relationship may be influenced by variations in psychological resilience, as resilience moderates the relationship between mental well-being and PSU [76]. It is also important to recognize the inherent limitation in our study, as sleep quality and mental health symptoms were assessed through self-reports. While both genders demonstrated increased PSU risk associated with social media use and entertainment apps, gender-specific trends were observed in the types of smartphone activities linked to PSU. For instance, males had lower odds of PSU when frequently calling friends. This finding aligns with the observation that men may use smartphones differently than women, with potentially fewer social pressures tied to online engagement [20, 21]. Interestingly, when considering the role of social support, our findings indicate that higher levels of perceived social support was not protective against PSU among younger individuals (21–30 years). However, in individuals older than 30, greater perceived social support was protective against PSU. This suggests that the protective influence of social support might differ as social dynamics and support systems evolve with age. Additionally, higher perceived social support was significantly associated with reduced PSU odds in females but not males. The existing literature on gendered patterns of social connectivity offers a potential explanation [77]. Females are more likely to use social connectivity sites and apps, making smartphones a tool for maintaining and developing relationships. However, the presence of offline and external social support networks may reduce their reliance on smartphones for these purposes. In contrast, males may not experience the same protective benefit, due to differences in how they use smartphones or expect support from their social networks [78]. This study provides valuable insights into the prevalence of PSU, emphasizing its community-wide and age-sensitive significance among Singaporean adult residents. A notable strength lies in the inclusion of middle-aged adults within a multi-ethnic population, an aspect often overlooked in PSU research. Surveying a broad and diverse population enables a comprehensive examination of PSU across various age groups, contributing to a more inclusive understanding of PSU in the general population. The study’s sampling methodology resulted in a sample closely reflecting the general population, thus enhancing the external validity of the findings. However, some limitations need to be highlighted. Our sample is drawn from eastern Singaporean adult residents. Future research should include a wider geographic region and age groups to complement our understanding of PSU on a national level. The survey response rate of 45.7% suggests the possibility of respondent bias, although it aligns with reported response rates for household community surveys in Singapore [79]. The cross-sectional design limits the ability to establish temporal trends, cohort dynamics, and causal explanations. Longitudinal, even panel designs, possibly as part of a larger health programme, would provide stronger evidence regarding the temporal, age and cohort-specific, and causal nature of smartphone use and associated problematic behaviours. While the SAS-SV has demonstrated reliability and validity in previous studies [34, 45], the cut-off values used in this study have not been validated in the local population. Although sensitivity analyses were conducted to address this concern, interpreting the applicability of these cut-off values should be contextualised accordingly. Lastly, reliance on self-reported data introduces the possibility of recall bias or social desirability bias, potentially leading to measurement error. This study revealed that the prevalence of PSU among adults in Singapore is considerable and requires further research. Notably, younger age, mental health symptoms, poor sleep quality, and engagement with social media or video/entertainment apps were found to be associated with PSU. Conversely, higher levels of perceived social support, utilising smartphones for communication with family or friends, and lesser time spent on smartphones were negatively associated with PSU. Furthermore, the elevated rates of PSU among the older population, in contrast to other studies, gives cause for concern. These results highlight the need for more studies, including mixed methods designs, and the need for interventions and treatment programs. Evaluating and exploring effective interventions that foster genuine human connections, on and offline, may provide valuable insights for policymakers, and mental health professionals seeking to address the challenges posed by the digital era.

Results for AI speaker acceptance factors 6. Results for profiling potential consumers of AI speakers The objective of this study is to identify the characteristics of users of AI speakers and predict potential consumers, with the aim of supporting effective advertising and marketing strategies in the fast-evolving media technology landscape. To do so, our analysis employs decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and XGboost, which are typical machine learning techniques for classification and leverages the 2019 Media & Consumer Research survey data from the Korea Broadcasting and Advertising Corporation (N = 3,922). The final XGboost model, which performed the best among the other machine learning models, specifically forecasts individuals aged 45–50 and 60–65, who are active on social networking platforms and have a preference for varied programming content, as the most likely future users. Additionally, the model reveals their distinct lifestyle patterns, such as higher internet usage during weekdays and increased cable TV viewership on weekends, along with a better understanding of 5G technology. This pioneering effort in IoT consumer research employs advanced machine learning to not just predict, but intricately profile potential AI speaker consumers. It elucidates critical factors influencing technology uptake, including media consumption habits, attitudes, values, and leisure activities, providing valuable insights for creating focused and effective advertising and marketing strategies.

The Internet of Things (IoT) technology serves as a pivotal force in shaping the hyper-connected society engendered by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Owing to the widespread adoption of mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablet PCs, IoT technology has permeated diverse facets of human life. It has garnered significant attention across various sectors, including automotive, agriculture, and energy. Within the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, IoT is exerting a transformative impact on businesses, governmental agencies, and consumers alike. IoT technology holds relevance not merely for industrial applications but also for consumer engagement. As more IoT applications are connected and interoperated together, individuals can enjoy a richer user experience through interactions between them [1]. Artificial Intelligence (AI) speakers are among the most popular of these products [2]. Defined broadly, AI speaker is a device that utilizes artificial intelligence algorithms, such as natural language processing, to interpret and execute voice commands from the user [3]. Since the launch of Amazon’s Echo in late 2014, numerous AI speaker products have been introduced by leading IT companies, including Google’s \"Google Home\" in 2017 and Apple’s \"Home Pod\" in 2018. A report from [4] suggests that the global smart speaker market is poised for a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 17.1%, potentially reaching $21.6 billion by 2027. AI speakers’ assistive capabilities and user-friendly technology can help not only the average consumer, but also the disabled, the elderly, and other marginalized groups. Nevertheless, as a consumer IoT product, the AI speaker market is showing signs of stagnation. This trend raises questions about the long-term market prospects for IoT products, such as AI speakers. Most consumer studies on IoT are theoretically anchored in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) or derivatives thereof. However, these studies often fall short in capturing the nuances of consumer behavior and decision-making processes. In the domain of advertising and marketing, machine learning algorithms are deemed highly valuable, yet their application has been minimally explored in IoT consumer research within the social sciences. Consequently, the present study endeavors to offer pragmatic solutions to the industry through an academic lens by incorporating machine learning algorithms as the primary research methodology. Utilizing publicly available consumer data, which encompasses a wide array of consumer information, this study aims to develop a predictive model for AI speaker adoption. It seeks to identify key predictors and formulate a consumer profile that is likely to embrace this technology. The primary objective of this study is to identify the characteristics of potential consumers of AI speakers, with the aim of supporting effective advertising and marketing strategies in the fast-evolving media technology landscape. Consumer behavior is not confined to a specific target but is influenced by an amalgamation of factors including demographic traits and consumption values. Accordingly, this study focuses on the wealth of consumer contextual data that can influence the adoption of AI speakers, which are representative IoT products. We aim to construct a predictive model for AI speaker adoption, identify its key predictors, and characterize the potential consumers of these devices. Recently, the fourth industrial revolution has emerged, integrating the physical world with the information age. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is driving this fourth industrial revolution [5]. The IIoT is the use of IoT in industries and applications that connect the physical world of sensors, devices, and machines with the Internet and use software to transform vast amounts of data into new insights and intelligence [5]. IIoT has been implemented in the area of environment monitoring, agriculture, construction industries, disaster management, solar assisted systems, robotics technology, health care, automotive industries, emergency response systems, supply chain management systems, transportation and many more [6,7]. First of all, with regard to public safety, IIOT continues to grow as a promising network paradigm for monitoring radioactive contamination levels, which pose a great threat to public health and environmental protection [8]. In public emergencies, deep learning applications based on IoT-native big data can be utilized to predict and manage dynamic changes in Online Public Sentiment [9]. Furthermore, while IIOTs already provide a variety of services such as traffic management, road safety, and data sharing, [10] proposed a novel methodology to ensure data security. In particular, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for intelligent health surveillance and diagnosis systems has been increasing globally [11]. As a result, attempts to integrate AI and IoT in the healthcare sector are being realized, including diagnostic systems for patients with severe heart disease [11], urinary tract infection detection systems [12], and health monitoring systems for patients with autism spectrum disorders [13]. IoT is not only penetrating the industrial sector, but also into the daily lives of consumers. IoT has boosted the automation and remote control that enable the monitoring and steering of the devices used in modern households [14]. The so-called ‘smart home’ is considered a promising area for IoT applications because companies with core wireless network technologies can provide smart home platform solutions. IoT technologies in smart homes can provide economic benefits and improved living by integrating with smart grid systems and enabling easy access to wireless networks [15]. Currently, consumer spending on the smart home sector is increasing globally [16]. Smart home technology also supports a wide range of smart devices, lighting, and other appliances. AI speakers are particularly popular, with 31% of U.S. households reportedly using them [17]. AI speaker is a type of consumer IoT device designed to interact with users through voice commands. Typically, this device is connected to the internet to access vast amounts of information and perform various tasks in real time, and is equipped with advanced artificial intelligence and speech recognition technology to understand natural language and respond to user requests [18]. It can also integrate with other devices and services, such as music streaming services, smart home systems, and virtual assistants, to provide more versatility. Overall, AI speakers have the advantage of giving people real-time access to information and easy control of their devices without the need for physical contact [19]. Moreover, the ability of AI speakers to assist humans can create opportunities to maintain, improve, or promote the functional abilities of people with disabilities and the elderly, as well as the convenience of the general consumer [20]. From this perspective, the mass adoption of consumer IoT products such as AI speakers could provide a good ratio of social return on investment by lowering the cost threshold [20]. Nevertheless, consumer IoT deployments consist only of few devices compared to IIoT networks [21]. Notably, the use of AI speakers is not very popular in some countries [18]. A decline in consumer engagement with AI speakers has been reported, as users have either ceased using the devices or are utilizing only a subset of their functionalities [22]. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of users is crucial for the successful diffusion and sustained use of AI speakers as a representative consumer IOT product [19]. Furthermore, efforts to identify potential consumers based on this understanding are needed. 2.2. The potential of machine learning algorithms as methodologies in consumer studies for IoT products Consumer research on Internet of Things (IoT) products can be broadly classified into four principal categories. First, a predominant number of studies focus on the elements influencing consumer acceptance of IoT and are largely grounded in models derived from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) [23–27]. Second, certain investigations examine the impact of individual factors on consumers’ receptivity towards IoT, further verifying the effect of salient characteristics of IoT products, as adopted from TAM, on consumers’ purchasing intentions and usage attitudes [28–30]. Third, emerging scholarship endeavors to conceptualize models that delineate consumer acceptance of IoT [31,32]. Fourth, [15] employ Peter Mobile’s UX Hive model to assess consumer satisfaction with location-based IoT services on smartphones, accounting for class-based differences. The acceptance of AI speakers, which is the main focus of our study, is also dominated by studies based on TAM and TAM-derived models as their theoretical foundation. In terms of TAM, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are considered to be strong influencers of smart speaker acceptance, while perceived enjoyment, the quality and diversity of a system, level of security, and price have been reported as additional influential factors in the extended version of TAM [33–35]. Among the studies based on UTAUT2, [36] identified performance expectancy, price value, and habit conditions were important variables in adopting AI speakers, while [37] argued that effort expectancy, habit, social influence, and hedonic motivation positively influence their acceptance. [38] conducted a study based on the Theory of Reasoned Action that underlies the development of these technology adoption theories and models, and their results show that perceived risk, privacy concerns, and perceived learnability of smart speakers influence consumers’ intention to use smart speakers for voice shopping, which in turn influences actual use. Notwithstanding their contributions, existing models, principally TAM—originally proposed by [39]—and its derivatives like UTAUT, UTAUT2, and E-TAM by [40], are not without limitations. These models, employing \"descriptive\" statistical methodologies such as multiple regression analysis and structural equation modeling, focus on relationships between determinants of technology use [41]. Notably, Partial Least Squares (PLS) structural equation modeling, commonly utilized in TAM and UTAUT research, restricts the number of potentially significant influential constructs that can be incorporated into an analysis [42]. Consequently, these models often overlook factors pertaining to social change processes and innovation [43]. Furthermore, the orientations of TAM and UTAUT predominantly emphasize consumer behavior rather than the ultimate objectives of technology usage, thus neglecting key motivators of user behavior and emotional engagement [44,45]. This limitation renders these models ineffective in providing actionable insights for practitioners to identify nuanced patterns in consumers’ usage and decision-making [43]. Specifically, [46] highlight the inadequacy of TAM in accounting for the acceptance of new Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), suggesting that users should be perceived as ’consumers’ of technology products rather than mere adopters. Furthermore, given the rapid advancements in digital technologies, the consumer decision-making landscape is evolving in complex ways that extant models struggle to encapsulate [47]. In this evolving context, scholars anticipate the necessity for more dynamic models to better capture the intricacies of consumer behavior [48]. The limitations of traditional statistical models can be partially addressed using machine learning techniques, which allow for the integration of extensive survey data without the need for arbitrary transformation or combination [49]. Machine learning algorithms are not bound by strict statistical assumptions, enabling them to offer predictive accuracy scores that leverage the maximum amount of available data to forecast individual consumer behavior. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that employs mathematical algorithms to learn from data, aiming to understand specific phenomena. It is a data-driven methodology where the algorithm self-learns to analyze extensive datasets, subsequently deriving a set of rules to construct a predictive model for new information [41]. Machine learning models gauge the predictive power by calculating the average difference between observed and predicted data. For instance, a machine learning-based regression model does not outright reject a hypothesis but rather estimates a target value based on the collected data [50]. However, implementing machine learning techniques is not without challenges. High error sensitivity remains a significant issue, as errors in the algorithm can lead to substantial problems [51]. Additionally, the interpretability of results generated by machine learning models is often a concern, as the decision-making processes of these algorithms are not readily transparent and may be difficult to understand [52]. Despite these hurdles, [51] anticipate that advancements in the field may soon overcome some of these current challenges. 2.3. Leveraging consumer data to identify potential customers for IoT products In an ever-changing external environment, where consumer consciousness and behavior are in constant flux, understanding the contextual factors surrounding consumers is crucial for effective market segmentation and analysis. Nowadays, user data—including lifestyle, hobbies, interests, purchasing behavior, and demographic factors—collected from various online and offline customer touchpoints, serves as a vital resource for advertising and marketing strategies. Big data significantly enriches the information available to advertisers and marketers about consumers [48]. In particular, third-party data enhances their ability to acquire desired user profiles for new customer acquisition [53]. While first-party data offers a narrower scope capturing user behavior on specific channels, third-party data expands the volume and breadth of targeting, thus improving the accuracy of user profiling. Within the realm of user-based targeting, look-alike targeting has emerged as an effective strategy for audience expansion. It identifies and targets individuals who exhibit behaviors and characteristics similar to those of the core audience, based on commonalities such as demographics, lifestyle, interests, and values [54,55]. Unfortunately, little research has been conducted on the consumer characteristics that influence the acceptance of IoT products. Since IoT products are new technologies, this study reviews the literature on factors related to the acceptance of new technology products and factors that influence consumption decisions. First, consumption value has been validated as a predictor of mobile technology adoption by several studies. [56] argued that hedonic and emotional values are better predictors of mobile auction acceptance than functional and social values. [57] analyzed the direct impact of the consumption value dimensions of price, functionality, social, emotional, situational, and novelty on the intention to use location-based mobile services. [58] found that the consumption value model predicted mobile banking acceptance among Israelis. The second is impulsivity and behavioral propensity. Recently, many researchers in the consumer and marketing fields have argued that irrational consumption tendencies should be considered as an important factor that can influence consumption [59]. The relationship between users’ personal dispositions or consumption behaviors and their use (or reaction) to new technologies has long been studied in the literature. Many studies have explored the relationship between individual impulsivity and excessive ICT use [60,61] argue that consumers’ inherent impulsivity is an important factor in understanding how and why consumers react impulsively to website quality. [62] found that the relationship of cell phones, a new media at the time of the study, was consistent with adolescents’ consumption styles: addictive use of cell phones was associated with a trendy and impulsive consumption style, and values such as passion for technology and being trendy were also associated with an impulsive consumption style. In contrast, moderate cell phone use was associated with environmentalism and frugality. Third, [63] argued that lifestyle is a way of living or the way one spends time and money and is an important human characteristic that influences consumption behavior. [64] argued that lifestyle differentially affects smartphone purchase motivation. [65] argue that lifestyle orientation leads to differences in cell phone usage. [66] examined the acceptance of seven technologies in China and found that lifestyle significantly influenced the differences between adopters and non-adopters. As the fourth factor, media use has great potential as a key predictor of new technology adoption. Empirical studies have found that media use may differ between adopters and non-adopters of new technologies. [67] found that the willingness to adopt digital TV in the United States was related to time spent on the internet. More recently, [68] empirically tested the spillover effect of internet usage on intention to use IoT, demonstrating the possibility that different media usage can affect the acceptance of IoT products. Based on the above discussion, it is important to predict the characteristics of potential consumers based on a comprehensive understanding of AI speaker users’ product acceptance factors in order to expand the consumer IoT market. Therefore, from a lookalike targeting perspective for audience expansion, this study aims to identify the characteristics of AI speaker users and predict potential consumers. To do so, we utilize third-party consumer data that is effective for market segmentation and understanding the context surrounding consumers, while using various machine learning algorithms as analytical techniques and comparing their performance as a powerful predictive methodology. Based on this objective, we propose the following research questions: What are the characteristics of AI speaker users identified through machine learning techniques? Which predictive models are most effective at forecasting AI speaker adoption when using machine learning techniques? What are the key predictors of AI speaker adoption as predicted by machine What are the characteristics of the potential consumers of AI speakers profiled by a machine learning model? This study employs data from the 2019 Media & Consumer Research (MCR) survey conducted by the Korea Broadcasting and Advertising Corporation (KOBACO) to predict AI speaker adoption. The MCR is an annual nationwide marketing survey in South Korea that has collected data on consumer media usage and behavior from 1999 to 2019. MCR survey consists of various questions about the demographic characteristics, lifestyle, media usage behavior, and product usage behavior of media audiences, and is used for various purposes such as establishing marketing data and advertising strategies for companies and advertising companies. MCR survey data as a secondary data source has the possibility that researchers may not fully recognize the problems of related data by not directly participating in the research process [69]. Nevertheless, in general, public data held by the government or public institutions are recognized as relatively more reliable than individually acquired data, as they are used as the basis for implementing government policies in developed countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom [70]. In particular, MCR data, which has large-scale data in terms of survey subjects, survey questions, and years of implementation, has a high research value as a source of information that allows random sampling, which is very important in terms of securing the representativeness of the sample and the validity of the research results, provided that the premise that it contains enough information to meet the research purpose is met. The 2019 MCR was conducted as a face-to-face, individual interview survey between July 15 and September 6, 2019. A total of 4,000 men and women aged 13 to 64 were sampled through cluster sampling and quota sampling based on gender and age proportionality. Of the total 4,000 respondents, 3,922 data were used in this study, excluding 68 respondents with missing data. Of the total 3,922 respondents, 321 were AI speaker users and 3,611 were non-users. 3.2 Procedure for deriving variables Out of the total 3,623 questions in the 2019 MCR, the study targeted all variables related to demographic characteristics and acceptance of new technology products; consumption values and Impulsivity and Behavioral Tendencies; media use; and lifestyle-related measures. To do so, two Ph.D students specializing in advertising and marketing were used as researchers to conduct the first round of data collection. A total of 138 questions were selected from the primary survey, including 30 questions on consumption values, 5 questions on impulsivity and behavioral tendencies, 36 questions on lifestyle, 65 questions on media usage attitudes, and 1 question on whether or not to use the dependent variable, AI speakers. In order to ensure the content validity and reliability of the measured variables, we conducted additional variable evaluation though academic and industry experts. two Professors, a Ph.Ds and four industry professionals in advertising and marketing were selected as the criteria. The experts’ evaluations were conducted individually via email in two rounds over the course of about a week. All experts were informed about the purpose of the evaluation, the voluntary nature of their participation, and their right to withdraw at any time. We got informed consent from all of our experts by handing them a consent form and having them sign to agree to the consent form before going into the assessment. In the first round, 95 of the 138 total questions received variable validity from all experts. For the remaining 43 items, we sent each expert a copy of the opinions of the other six experts to share and reconcile their views, and then asked them again whether they wanted to include variables. As a result, more than six experts agreed that 17 out of 43 questions were appropriate as measurement variables, and 112 questions were finally selected as measurement variables. The final set of variables consisted of 26 consumption values, 5 impulsivity and behavioral tendencies, 22 lifestyle, 57 media time and attitudes, and 1 question on the dependent variable, AI speaker usage (see S1 Appendix). This study was conducted in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. First, all participants provided informed consent via email prior to their participation in the expert assessment. We then obtained additional handwritten, signed consent forms from participants using the PLOS Journal form. A total of 26 items were included in the list of 10 sub-dimensions that make up the five consumption values. Product attribute value was made up of four utility-oriented items and two safety-oriented items, but personal-oriented value consisted of two autonomy-oriented items and three self-expression-oriented items. Other-oriented value was composed of two display-oriented items, while consumption community-oriented value included three social justice-oriented items and five eco-friendly-oriented items. Lastly, consumer subjective value splits over two autonomy-oriented items and three self-expression-oriented items. All the items belonging to consumption values were measured on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from ‘① Not at all’ to ‘⑥ Very much’. 3.4.2. Impulsivity and behavioral tendencies. Impulsivity and behavioral tendencies were measured by a binary classification of ‘rational consumer tendencies’ and ‘irrational consumer tendencies’. Rational tendencies consisted of a total of 5 statements related to unplanned consumption, including sufficient information-seeking behavior before purchase and comparison of the utility of goods and services. Like consumption value, items related to impulsivity and behavioral tendencies were designed to respond on a 6-point Likert scale from ‘① not at all’ to ‘⑥ very much’. The scales related to lifestyle are divided into four categories: leisure activities, life values, attitudes toward new technology, and life satisfaction. Leisure activities were converted from three existing items that individually listed the leisure time required for each day of the week, such as weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays, into ‘average weekday leisure time’ and ‘average weekend leisure time’. Second, three items measuring ‘alone leisure orientation’ were placed. Life values consisted of seven items measuring ‘tradition/Confucianism’, ‘individualism’, and ‘hedonism’. Attitudes toward new technology consisted of five items measuring ‘understanding and favorability toward 5G’, and the last item measuring life satisfaction was also measured by five statements. Except for one item ‘weekly leisure time’ that was recorded in minutes, the remaining 21 items were measured on a 6-point Likert scale from ‘① not at all’ to ‘⑥ very much’. 3.4.4. Media usage and attitude. Variables for media usage and attitude split over media usage amount, attitude towards media, and SNS activity. In the media usage amount question of MCR, the weekday, Saturday, and Sunday usage times of eight media such as terrestrial broadcasting, comprehensive programming channels, cable TV, radio, and DMB are recorded respectively. In this study, the Saturday and Sunday usage times were combined and analyzed by converting them into “weekday usage time” and “weekend usage time”. Next, the attitude towards the media is measured by the degree of entertainment value, reliability, fairness, informativeness, and selectivity that respondents feel about each medium. Respondents are asked to respond on a 5-point Likert scale from “① not at all” to “⑤ very much”. Finally, regarding SNS, there is a question about weekly usage frequency. 4.4 Dependent variable: Acceptance of AI speakers In this study, we analyze the acceptance of AI speakers, which are representative products of the Internet of Things, to identify research problems 1 and 2. We converted cases where the product is used to ‘1’ and cases where it is not used to ‘0’ respectively as categorical variables and used them as dependent variables for each analysis. In this study, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and XGboost, which are typical machine learning techniques for classification or prediction, were used in the analysis. After deriving the optimal model for each of the five machine learning algorithms through 10-fold cross validation, we compare the performance of the models and finally selected one machine learning model with the best performance as the prediction model of AI speaker acceptance. Decision tree is a technique to represent the results of recursive partitioning, which divides data into subsets according to partitioning rules based on actual decisions or probabilities of occurrence, in a tree structure. The goal is to find patterns and rules in the data by partitioning the nodes consisting of variables to form a tree. It is a method of machine learning that shows which bifurcations of conditions lead to optimal decisions. The structure of the tree starts from the root node, which is the top node that contains all the data sets, and gradually extends from the parent node to two or more child nodes, which is called the splitting method. The lowest node that no longer splits is called a leaf node. Random forest is a popular ensemble technique that combines bagging and decision tree models, using the bootstrap method to generate a large number of samples and applying a decision tree model to synthesize the results. It was developed by [71] to compensate for the overfitting problem of decision trees. Bagging, which stands for Bootstrap Aggregation, creates n bootstrap sets with the same number of data as the original data through restoration extraction from original data to create each decision tree model. In other words, random forests randomize not only observations but also variables in the process of forming multiple tree models to form uncorrelated trees and adopt the results predicted by the majority of trees. As the model building process reduces the correlation between the decision trees, the forecast error is reduced [71]. A support vector machines is an algorithm that finds the optimal decision space by finding a hyperplane that increases the distance between two classes and creates a very homogeneous split on either side. In other words, the algorithm finds the boundary with the greatest width between the different data among the multiple boundaries that divide the data. The basic idea of this algorithm is to learn how to divide the two groups by measuring the distance between the data in each of the two groups to be classified, finding the center between the two data, which is called the decision boundary, and finding the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin in the center. If it can be divided by a straight line, a linear classification model is applied; otherwise, a non-linear classification model is used. The support vectors are the observations that are located a margin away from this max-margin hyperplane, and by definition, if the position of the support vectors changes, the max-margin hyperplane will also change. On the other hand, the hypersurface that serves to separate the dataset has the form of N-1 dimensions in N dimensions. For example, objects captured on a plane in two dimensions are separated by a one-dimensional subspace, a straight line, which separates them into two populations, each bounded by a straight line. An artificial neural network is a statistical learning algorithm that predicts the optimal output value for an input value through data-driven iterative learning by artificial neurons that form a network of synaptic connections like the human brain [72]. In general, an artificial neural network consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. Each layer is composed of one or more nodes, which are connected and interact with the nodes in the other layers with certain weights. Each node in the input layer is connected to each neuron in the subsequent hidden layer, which in turn is connected to the output layer. The input layer consists of nodes corresponding to each input variable, and the hidden layer consists of multiple hidden nodes. In the case of the hidden layer, it is responsible for processing the linear combination of variable values received from the input layer into a nonlinear function and passing it back to the output layer or another hidden layer. The output layer refers to the nodes corresponding to the output variable, and in the case of a nominal target variable, it creates as many output nodes as there are classes. A representative algorithm using boosting methods, the XGboost algorithm stands for Extreme Gradient boosting. XGboost utilizes an objective function consisting of a loss function representing the difference between predicted and actual values and a complexity function of a tree model to create an optimal model. It has the advantage of reducing the variance in the overall model and improving the predictive power by combining multiple classifiers with relatively low predictive power into a classifier with relatively high one [73]. This paper aims to develop a predictive model of IoT adoption based on consumer contextual data and empirically verify whether there are latent predictors not captured by existing theories and models. To this end, this study was conducted in four stages: data preparation, model generation and selection, model evaluation and final selection, and potential consumer profiling. The process of building a predictive model is shown in Fig 1 below. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315540.g001 5. Results for AI speaker acceptance factors 5.1. Descriptive statistics & analytic sample As shown in Table 1, out of a total of 3,922 people, there were 321 users and 3,611 non-users of AI speakers. AI speaker users are 53.9% male and 46.1% female, while non-users are 50.3% male and 49.7% female. The age composition of the user group is dominated by those in their 20s (28.35%) and 30s (28.04%). The non-user group has a higher proportion of older users, with the highest proportion in their 40s (21.26%) and 50s (21.41%). The educational attainment of AI speaker users is 67.60% college, 26.8% high school, 2.80% elementary and middle school, and 2.80% graduate school, while the non-user of AI speaker is 50.40% college, 37.97% high school, 8.89% elementary and middle school, and 2.63% graduate school. The occupations of AI speaker users include office workers (24.30%), students (20.87%), and sales/service workers (20.56%). In contrast, the non-user group’s occupational distribution is more evenly distributed, with all occupations in the 10% range, except for administrative/professional and no occupation/etc. The largest difference in composition between the two groups is marital status. While the user group has a similar mix of married (52.65%) and single (46.11%) people, the non-user group is overwhelmingly made up of married people (63.94%) over single people (32.51%). Demographic characteristics of AI speaker users and non-users. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315540.t001 However, a significant numerical disparity between analysis groups can lead to the problem of statistical bias, where the tendencies of the larger group unduly influence the analysis. Therefore, this study adopted a ‘matching’ statistical method to make the distribution of demographic characteristics between the user group and the non-user group identical and adjust the data. Statistical matching via the Random Forest algorithm was employed to align the distribution of confounding variables between the treatment and control groups. 321 AI speaker users were categorized into a treatment group, while 3,611 non-users formed the control group. A dependent variable was assigned with ’1’ for instances where the product was in use and ’0’ for instances where it was not. Fig 2 illustrates the distribution of propensity scores between the AI speaker user group and the non-user group, as predicted by the random forest algorithm. Given that the criterion for the dependent variable during model training is whether AI speakers are in use or not, the propensity score (depicted in blue) for the user group is observed to be higher than that for the non-user group (depicted in red). Comparison of propensity score histograms between users and non-users of AI speakers predicted by random forest algorithm. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315540.g002 To equate the distribution of propensity scores between the two groups, the nearest-neighbor matching algorithm was employed for data matching. Based on a comparative test, which indicated the highest similarity in propensity scores when the sample sizes for both the user and non-user groups were equal, we configured the sample sizes in a 1:1 ratio for the nearest-neighbor matching algorithm. Fig 2 displays the distribution of propensity scores between the matched AI speaker user and non-user groups. As a result of the matching process, 320 users and 320 non-users with the most closely aligned propensity scores were selected for analysis. A comparison of Figs 2 and 3 reveals that the distribution of non-users, which initially leaned towards lower propensity scores, closely aligns with the user group in Fig 3 post-matching. Propensity score histograms of AI speaker users and non-users matched by the nearest neighbor algorithm. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315540.g003 5.2. Selection of a predictive model for AI speaker acceptance To develop a predictive model for AI speaker demand, this study performed 10-fold cross-validation using a decision tree model and achieved a cp value of 0.047, representing the lowest cross-validation error rate. The validated decision tree model was then tested with 76 data points, yielding 55 True Positives (TPs) for correctly identifying AI speaker users, 17 True Negatives (TNs) for correctly classifying non-users, 9 False Negatives (FNs) for misclassifying users as non-users, and 47 False Positives (FPs) for incorrectly identifying non-users as users. The random forest model demonstrated optimal performance when configured with 500 generated trees (ntree = 500) and 7 randomized variables per tree (mtry = 7). Using these hyper-parameters, the confusion matrix revealed 52 TPs and 26 TNs for accurate user and non-user identification, along with 12 FNs and 38 FPs for inaccuracies. The radial kernel support vector machine model, optimized with sigma = 0.0079 and C = 1, yielded test results of 36 TPs, 12 TNs, 2 FNs, and 26 FPs. The neural network model performed best with 6 hidden nodes (size = 6) and a weight decay metric of 0.3 (decay = 0.3), resulting in a confusion matrix of 42 TPs, 27 TNs, 22 FNs, and 37 FPs. The XGboost model emerged as the most effective when hyper-parameters were set at nrounds = 200, max_depth = 3, eta = 0.3, gamma = 0, colsample_bytree = 0.8, min_child_weight = 1, and subsample = 1. Its predictive results included 52 TPs, 28 TNs, 12 FNs, and 36 FPs. Table 2 summarizes the confusion matrix results for all six machine learning algorithms tested for AI speaker demand prediction. Based on metrics such as sensitivity (0.813), F1-score (0.684), and AUC (0.665), the XGboost model is identified as the best predictive model for AI speaker acceptance.

Predictors of AI speaker adoption In this study, we conducted a Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) value analysis to identify significant predictors for the adoption of AI speakers. The SHAP value is a measure of a feature’s contribution across all possible combinations of features and is calculated by weighting and summing the marginal contributions of different feature values. Due to its robustness and interpretability, SHAP values are considered effective for understanding both individual predictions and overall model behavior [74]. Initially, we assessed 25 variables in ascending order of SHAP values and eliminated the least impactful 12, refining our list to the key 13 variables. Fig 4 visualizes these variables, indicating both their importance and their directional influence on AI speaker adoption. In this figure, each dot represents an individual observation’s SHAP value for a particular variable; the vertical axis displays the variable value, while the horizontal axis represents the corresponding SHAP value. Relative to the centerline at ’0’, positive SHAP values suggest a positive effect on the outcome, whereas negative values indicate the opposite. The color scheme also communicates the variable’s value, with purple representing higher values and yellow representing lower values. Key predictors of AI speaker acceptance based on SHAP value. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315540.g004 The most significant variables, ranked by their SHAP values, are as follows: ① Understanding of 5G (under.5g), ② Average mobile usage time per day on weekdays (mo.time), ③ Average leisure time per day on weekends (lei.week), ④ Frequency of SNS usage (sns), ⑤ Average internet usage time per day on weekends (in.week), ⑥ Present-oriented life values (today), ⑦ Attitude towards the entertainment value of public broadcasting (tv.enter), ⑧ Average viewing time of comprehensive programming channels on weekends (jo.week), ⑨ Average viewing time of comprehensive programming channels on weekdays (jo.time), ⑩ Average internet usage time on weekdays (in.time), ⑪ Average cable broadcasting viewing time on weekends (ca.week), ⑫ Utility-oriented consumption value (util), and ⑬ Attitude toward sensationalism in cable broadcasting (ca.prov) (refer to Fig 4 for more details). 5.4. Relationship between AI speaker acceptance and key predictors The most potent predictor for the adoption of AI speakers was the understanding of 5G. Its SHAP value exhibits a stable positive influence on the outcome variable, signifying that AI speaker users generally have a better grasp of 5G technology than non-users. Additionally, average leisure time on weekends has a significant association with AI speaker adoption, with the SHAP value indicating that users are prone to spend over six hours in leisure activities during weekends. Conversely, the value of being present-oriented was negatively correlated with the likelihood of using AI speakers (see Fig 5). Graphs of SHAP value by key predictors of lifestyle and consumption value. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315540.g005 Media-related factors comprised the largest category, accounting for nine variables. Notably, the SHAP values for weekday and weekend internet usage were positively correlated with the likelihood of adopting AI speakers. Specifically, the weekday internet usage SHAP value increases consistently, suggesting that greater internet usage during weekdays enhances the probability of AI speaker adoption. However, the SHAP value for weekend internet usage initially decreases until approximately 30 minutes before rebounding and stabilizing around the 5-hour mark. Social media usage also exhibited a positive relationship, indicating that frequent social media users are more inclined to use AI speakers. In contrast, mobile usage time during weekdays displayed a declining SHAP value as usage time increased, implying an inverse relationship with AI speaker adoption (see Fig 6). Graphs of SHAP value by key predictors of media. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315540.g006 Additionally, the SHAP value for the average viewing time of comprehensive programming channels showed variable significance based on whether the data was collected during weekdays or weekends. We observed that AI speaker users are more likely to spend extended periods watching these channels on weekdays but limit themselves to 70–80 minutes over the weekend. Moreover, the SHAP value for weekend cable broadcasting viewing time revealed a more intricate trend, increasing within the 50–100 minute range before declining. Further, the SHAP value associated with utility-oriented consumption showed a complex pattern: initially declining when the consumption value score is low, then rising in the latter half of the scoring range (see Fig 5). This suggests that consumers who place high emphasis on factors like product quality, price, and time-saving are more predisposed to adopt AI speakers. Lastly, our investigation into the potential interaction effects among the 13 selected key predictors yielded no significant interactions, reinforcing the individual importance of each variable in predicting AI speaker adoption (see S1 Appendix). 6. Results for profiling potential consumers of AI speakers This study employed the XGboost final model to forecast the likelihood of AI speaker adoption among non-users, aiming to profile potential consumers. The model’s predictions ranged from 1.9% to 98.8%. Data were extracted from 234 individuals in the top 10% and 404 in the bottom 10% of predicted usage probabilities. These groups were categorized and compared based on their characteristics. As shown in Table 3, regarding to demographics, a statistically significant difference in education levels between the groups was also noted; 52.56% of the top group had college education compared to 58.91% in the bottom group (two-tailed, p = .002). In comparison, independent sample Yuen’s t-test results show that the demographic variables of age, income, and expenditure are all statistically insignificant at the 95% confidence interval. However, the results for age and expenditure are very close to the p-value of 0.05, which requires more careful interpretation. The average age of potential consumers in the top 10% of AI speakers is 41.68 years old, slightly higher than the bottom 10% (M = 39.19). Actually, we can see that the top 10% of AI speakers has a higher proportion of 45-50-year olds and 60–65 year olds than the bottom 10%. This suggests that people in these age groups are more likely to be the primary potential consumers. The graph on the left in Fig 7 provides a visual representation of this result. Furthermore, the spending level of the top 10% group is somewhat higher than the bottom 10% group (KRW 1,016,000), on average, compared to KRW 761,000. According to the Chi-square test, the difference in occupation between the two groups was not statistically significant (see Table 4). Age distribution and 5G understanding between the potential consumer group and the bottom 10% group for AI speaker. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315540.g007 Fisher’s exact test results for gender, education, and occupation variables. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315540.t003 Chi-square test results for the occupation variable. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315540.t004 Analysis of the 13 key predictive variables mostly aligned with the SHAP value findings, barring three variables. The potential consumer group was notably more active on social media and spent more time watching comprehensive programming channels. Specifically, they used social media approximately 14.88 times per month, almost five times more frequently than the bottom group (M = 9.31, SD = 14.23); Tw(636) = 4.93, p < .001, δ = 0.4. Moreover, this group spent more time watching comprehensive programming channels on both weekdays and weekends compared to the bottom group, reinforcing the SHAP value analysis for weekday viewing but complicating the interpretation for weekend viewing. The potential consumer group also exhibited tendencies to use the internet more during weekdays and watch more cable TV during weekends than the bottom 10%. They spent an average of 43 minutes on the internet on weekdays and watched about 70 minutes of cable TV on weekends, both higher than the bottom group. Interestingly, their mobile usage on weekdays was lower compared to the bottom group. Attitudinal differences were observed between the groups concerning public broadcasting and cable TV. The potential consumer group rated public broadcasting as less entertaining but found cable TV to be more sensational. Understanding of 5G emerged as a significant factor among potential consumers, corroborating its role as the strongest predictor in the SHAP value analysis. They scored an average of 4 in understanding 5G, significantly higher than the bottom 10% and the general respondents. This variable had the highest effect size among all key variables. The right-hand side of Fig 7 visualizes the difference in understanding of 5G between the potential consumer group and the bottom 10%. The potential consumer group spent an average of about 6 hours per day on leisure on weekends (SD = 268.27), which was 50 minutes longer than the bottom 10% group’s average of about 5 hours and 10 minutes (SD = 131.37); Tw(170.54) = 2.44, p = .02, ξ = 0.18. Finally, the potential consumer group of AI speaker was found to have higher levels of utility-oriented consumption values than the bottom group (see Table 5). However, of the total 13 key predictors, present-centered life values and weekend internet time did not reveal statistical significance between the two groups within the 95% confidence interval. Independent sample Yuen’s t-test results for AI speaker potential consumers and bottom 10% group. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315540.t005 Using data from the 2019 Media & Consumer Research (MCR) survey conducted by the Korea Broadcasting and Advertising Corporation, this study builds AI speaker adoption prediction model using five machine learning techniques: decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and XGboost. In the AI speaker acceptance prediction analysis, the XGboost model was selected as the final model with the best performance among the five models. The main predictors included understanding of 5G, average mobile usage per day on weekdays, average leisure time per day on weekends, frequency of social media usage, average internet usage per day on weekends, present-oriented life values, attitudes toward the entertainment value of public broadcasting, average total channel viewing per day on weekends, average total channel viewing per day on weekdays, average internet usage per day on weekdays, average cable broadcasting viewing per day on weekends, utility-oriented consumption values, and attitudes toward sensationalism in cable broadcasting. Also, the results identified key demographic characteristics and consumer behaviors that influence future AI speaker adoption. Individuals between the ages of 45–50 and 60–65 were identified as potential consumers of AI speakers, as they are frequent users of social networking services and prefer comprehensive programming channels. Potential AI speaker consumers have high internet usage during the week and cable viewing on the weekends. They also have a high level of understanding of 5G technology and spend more time on leisure on the weekends. These results show that AI speaker ad marketing practitioners need to take a strategic approach to media planning, prioritizing social media and aggregation channels, and designing ad marketing concepts and messages that target relatively older audience. Additionally, they can also consider a “day-of-the-week” media strategy, where they differentiate the quantity of their ads on the internet on weekdays and on cable on weekends respectively. The study contributes both academically and practically to the literature, identifying new variables associated with the acceptance of new technology products and generating findings beneficial for the industry. To navigate this rapidly changing environment, industry stakeholders require effective advertising and marketing strategies. In this regard, this study utilizes consumer data-driven analyses to discover new variables not covered by existing models, demonstrating that factors such as consumer values, attitudes, and lifestyles significantly affect IoT product acceptance. Moreover, this study provides invaluable information about target consumer behaviors, such as media usage, attitudes toward media, consumption values, and leisure activities. Such data is often challenging to acquire through individual company resources and day-to-day business operations. Consequently, the study is expected to make a practical contribution to the development of industry advertising and marketing strategies. Furthermore, the academic value of this study lies in its empirical validation of machine learning techniques as viable research methodologies in the social sciences, particularly within the realms of digital advertising and marketing. [75] highlight the challenges traditional methods face in analyzing interactive communication in digital media and advocated for the adoption of new analytic techniques. They critiqued the excessive focus on quantitative methodologies in Korea’s digital media advertising research and called for the inclusion of qualitative research enriched by inductive reasoning. However, the universal validity of qualitative research has long been a subject of debate, due in part to the limited sample sizes and open-ended research methodologies. Machine learning techniques, capable of refining and analyzing large data sets, stand out as a methodology that can address these limitations. Specifically, machine learning does not rely on the data assumptions often needed in traditional statistical analyses, thus offering greater flexibility for empirical researchers. Despite these contributions, the study has its limitations. First of all, it focuses more on the consumers of new technology rather than the technology itself. Although the study aimed to include a comprehensive set of variables, questions remain about the sufficiency of the independent variables analyzed. Only eight lifestyle variables were selected as independent variables through a two-step preliminary research process, leaving open the possibility that additional factors could enrich the analysis. This study leveraged the MCR public survey data to access high-quality, rich consumer information, but the sample size of 321 AI speaker users out of 3,922 respondents is relatively small. This limitation could affect the reliability of the machine learning model, depending on the data partitioning into training and test sets. Moreover, this study has produced useful results as an initial step for look-alike targeting strategies in advertising marketing, but due to the limitation of secondary analysis using existing data, it has not reached the stage of suggesting detailed advertising marketing strategies. Therefore, we hope that future studies will be conducted to secure and analyze sufficiently large and rich consumer data to increase the reliability of the research results and suggest more realistic and in-depth advertising marketing strategies.

The study aims to examine the prevalence of PCC, including cognitive impairment, functional limitation, and depressive symptoms, along with relevant risk factors, while controlling for individuals’ pre-illness status measured in 2018. A cross-sectional retrospective study utilized the 2018 and 2020 Health and Retirement Study surveys. Sample included individuals with COVID-19 (n = 409; average age 64) and individuals without COVID-19 (n = 8689; average age 59). COVID-19 positive: Individuals with positive tests, physician diagnoses, emergency room visits, or hospitalizations for COVID-19 between 2019–2020. Cognition was assessed using immediate and delayed word-recall tests, serial seven subtractions, and backward counting. Functional status was measured using limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs. Depressive symptoms were measured using the modified Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression scale. Participants’ perception of experiencing PCC was collected. Logistic regression and propensity score matching were employed for these analyses. Among 409 COVID-19-positive respondents (14% hospitalized), 24% exhibited new impairments after COVID-19 infection. Noteworthy increases in functional limitation (OR [95% CI]: 2.18 [0.95, 0.97], p < 0.001) and a marginal rise in cognitive impairment (1.79 [0.99, 3.32], p = 0.053) following COVID-19 infection were observed in comparison to their pre-COVID-19 baseline. Compared to 8689 non-COVID-19 cases, the 409 COVID-19 positives showed increased functional decline (1.78 [1.26, 2.51], p = 0.001) and depressive symptoms (1.41 [1.04, 1.91], p = 0.03). Factors associated with PCC included pre-existing impairments, lower education, female gender, prior hospitalization, higher comorbidity, lower wealth, and mild COVID-19. A notable number of respondents, especially older individuals with fewer pre-existing health conditions, experienced PCC without awareness. Compared to an individual’s pre-illness baseline and uninfected individuals, being positive for COVID-19 raised the risk of functional limitation, depressive symptoms, and cognitive impairment. Additionally, addressing PCC through both subjective and objective approaches is essential to alleviate individual and societal burdens.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 770 million people worldwide since the end of 2019 [1]. Nearly 45% of COVID-19 survivors experience lingering symptoms and disabilities following infection, known as post-COVID conditions (PCC) [2–4]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines post-COVID conditions as new, returning, or ongoing health problems occurring ≥4 weeks after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. The prevalence of PCC and the specific occurrence of various PCCs have been well-documented across multiple studies. For instance, the prevalence of depressive symptoms 12 weeks or more after infection ranges from 11% to 28%, with clinically significant depression or severe depressive symptoms reported in 3% to 12% of individuals [5]. Fatigue is observed in approximately 32% of individuals beyond 12 weeks post-COVID-19 diagnosis, while cognitive impairment affects an estimated 22% [6]. These ongoing health problems can significantly hinder the resumption of daily activities, reduce quality of life, increase healthcare expenditures, and diminish productivity [3, 7, 8]. Despite the considerable impact posed by PCC, the prevalence of this condition remains undetermined. Existing studies have mainly described the prevalence of PCC at follow-up but are unable to compare symptoms and disabilities to pre-infection baseline (cognition, functional limitation, and depressive symptoms) [9–12]. This presents a significant concern, as research indicates that individuals with pre-existing conditions such as anxiety, depression, and disability are disproportionately affected by both COVID-19 and PCC [13–17]. Furthermore, studies investigating PCC frequently lack a proper comparison group [18–20]. As a result, the relationship between COVID-19 infection and observed outcomes remains unclear. It is imperative to gain a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence of PCC and identify the risk factors associated with this condition. This knowledge will play a crucial role in effectively identifying and managing PCC. This study aims to address the existing knowledge gap by conducting pre- and post-COVID-19 comparisons, as well as a comparative analysis between COVID-positive and COVID-negative individuals, with a focus on cognitive impairment, functional limitations, and depressive symptoms, utilizing data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Furthermore, the study seeks to identify factors associated with the exacerbation of these conditions among individuals affected by COVID-19. The HRS, sponsored by the National Institute on Aging (grant number NIA U01AG009740) and conducted by the University of Michigan, is a biennial longitudinal study of over 20,000 Americans aged 51 and older, along with their spouses, without age restrictions. Since 1992, the study has collected data regarding income, health insurance, physical health, and cognitive function in respondents.HRS divided the sample into face-to-face and telephone interviews. However, due to COVID-19, all interviews were conducted by telephone, and a COVID-19 module was introduced in 2020, administered to half of the households originally designated for face-to-face interviews. For this analysis, we studied all respondents who completed the HRS 2020 COVID-19 module and interviews conducted in 2018 and 2020 in which cognition, function, and depressive symptoms were evaluated. Ethics Statement: Since the data were deidentified and publicly accessible, IRB approval was not necessary for this analysis. Social demographic and pre-COVID-19/baseline health conditions Specific demographics and clinical data (age, sex, race, education, marital status, health insurance, total wealth, number of health conditions, and hospitalization between 2018 and 2020) were extracted from the RAND HRS longitudinal file 2020. The number of health conditions is the sum of self-reported doctor-diagnosed: high blood pressure; diabetes; cancer of any kind except skin cancer; heart problems; emotional or psychiatric problems; arthritis; dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. Total wealth is calculated as the sum of all wealth components (i.e., the net value of real estate, Individual Retirement Accounts, checking, and savings), less all debt (i.e., home loans). COVID-19-related variables were extracted from the COVID-19 module of the 2020 HRS survey. COVID-19 history is dichotomized as \"positive\" or \"negative.\" We defined COVID-19 positive if the respondent answered \"Yes\" to one of the below questions: \"Have you had COVID,\" \"Tested positive for COVID,\" \"Doctor confirmed COVID,\" \"Visited emergency room due to COVID\" or \"Admitted to a hospital due COVID.\" Other COVID-19-related variables were also collected, such as positive COVID-19 test year and month, nights in the hospital for COVID-19, and whether participants perceived themselves as having PCC (“Have you experienced any lingering physical or mental health effects from the virus?”). For individuals with COVID-19 positive, we calculated the time since COVID-19 infection using the time of the HRS 2020 survey completed less the time of the positive COVID-19 test. Pre- and post-COVID-19 symptoms and disabilities measurements We defined measurements collected in 2018 as pre-COVID-19/baseline and those collected in the 2020 survey as post-COVID-19/follow-up. Cognition was extracted from 2018 and 2020 HRS Core data and assessed using a 27-score validated battery that included immediate and delayed word-recall tests, serial seven subtractions, and backward counting. Cognitive impairment was defined as a total score of less than 12 [21, 22]. Functional status and depressive symptoms were extracted from the RAND HRS longitudinal file 2020. Functional status was measured using six activities of daily living (ADLs: walking, dressing, bathing, eating, getting into and out of bed, and toileting) and five instrumental ADLs (IADLs: preparing a hot meal, shopping for groceries, making telephone calls, taking medicines, managing money). A sum of ADLs and IADLs, with a score ≥1, was defined as having functional limitation [23]. Depressive symptoms were measured using the modified 8-item Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression (CESD) scale [24], with scores ≥4, defined as having high depressive symptoms [25]. We further defined self-awareness of PCC as participants who develop new cognitive impairments, physical limitations, or high depressive symptoms after a COVID-19 infection, as previously defined, and perceive themselves as having PCC. We summarized data using median and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables. Bivariable logistic regressions were conducted to examine the association between demographic, pre-COVID-19/baseline number of health conditions, pre-COVID-19/baseline cognitive impairment, functional limitation, and depressive symptoms, as well as COVID-19 infection (positive, negative). All analyses were performed using Stata statistical software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and R (R Development Core, Vienna, Austria). A two-sided P < .05 denoted statistical significance. For the primary objective, we used the McNemar test among individuals with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis to determine if there were differences in cognitive impairment, functional limitation, and high depressive symptoms before and after COVID-19. Then, we conducted multivariable logistic regression models in individuals with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis to identify factors associated with worsened cognition, functional ability, and high depressive symptoms after COVID-19 infection. For the third objective, multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between COVID-19 diagnosis (positive versus negative) and post-COVID-19/follow-up cognitive impairment, functional limitation, and high depressive symptoms, separately, controlling for pre-COVID-19/baseline conditions. Initial multivariable logistic regression models adjusted demographics, hospitalization between 2018 and 2020, pre-COVID-19/baseline health conditions, and pre-COVID-19/baseline cognitive impairment, functional limitation, or depressive symptoms. To evaluate the robustness of the results, we conducted an analysis using propensity-score matching to reduce confounding effects in the study [26, 27]. Propensity scores were calculated using multivariable logistic regression for cognitive impairment, functional limitation, and high depressive symptoms model separately. For each model, the propensity score included variables that may impact both COVID-19 history and outcomes (post-COVID-19/follow-up cognition, functional limitation, or depressive symptoms) and were unbalanced between exposure groups. Variables included were demographic, hospitalization between 2018 and 2020, number of health conditions at pre-COVID-19/baseline, and pre-COVID-19/baseline cognition, functional limitation, and depressive symptoms. Association between COVID-19 history (positive versus negative) and post-COVID-19/follow-up cognitive impairment, functional limitation, and high depressive symptoms were then estimated by multivariable logistic regression models using propensity score matching. Matching was performed based on propensity scores using a 1:1 nearest-neighbor algorithm without replacement with a caliper width of 0.05. The best-matched cohort was identified based on the most balanced distribution of propensity scores and the best balance in individual covariates between groups (COVID-19 positive versus negative). The analyses encompassed 409 COVID-19-positive cases and 8689 COVID-19-negative cases (Fig 1). Demographic and baseline cognition, function, and depressive symptoms are summarized in Table 1, both in unmatched and propensity-score–matched analytic samples. In the unmatched sample, as compared to respondents who reported being negative for COVID-19, those who reported being COVID-19 positive tended to be younger (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 0.96 [0.95, 0.97], p<0.001), non-White (0.71 [0.5,9 0.85], p<0.001), and experiencing functional limitation at baseline (1.38 [1.05, 1.78], p = 0.02, eTable1). As compared to respondents without any health insurance, those with federal insurance only (0.44 [0.32, 0.62], p<0.001) or both federal and private insurance (0.45[0.31, 0.67], p<0.001) were less likely to report being COVID-19 positive (eTable1). Those with a total wealth over $125,000 were less likely to report being positive for COVID-19 than those with a total wealth under $25,000 (0.73 [0.59, 0.92], p = 0.005, eTable1). Abbreviation: Health retirement stud = HRS. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315425.g001 Demographic, baseline cognition, function, and depressive symptoms by COVID history, before and after propensity-score matching. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315425.t001 Pre-and post-COVID-19 cognition, function, and depressive symptoms Among the 409 respondents with COVID-19 positive, the HRS 2020 survey was completed, on average, two months after their infection. Out of these individuals, 57 were admitted to the hospital, with a median (IQR) length of stay of 4 (8) days. Mechanical ventilation was required for 9% (n = 5) of the hospitalized patients. After COVID-19 infection, a total of 24% of individuals exhibited a minimum of one new impairment, with specific proportions corresponding to distinct impairments: 12% for cognitive impairment, 9% for functional limitation, and 12% for high depressive symptoms. McNemar test revealed a marginal association with an increase in cognitive impairment (1.79 [0.99, 3.32], p = 0.053), as well as a significant increase in functional limitation (OR [95% CI]: 2.18 [0.95, 0.97], p<0.001) following COVID-19 infection when compared to their own pre-COVID-19 baseline. Memory performance was impacted, as evidenced by significant decreases in immediate word recall (from 5.85 to 5.49, p = 0.001) and delayed word recall (from 4.90 to 4.48, p<0.001, Fig 2). The functional impairment affected various ADLs and IADLs (Fig 2). However, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of high depressive symptoms before and after COVID-19 infection (1.52 [0.93, 2.51], p = 0.10). Change in individual cognition, functional limitation, and depressive symptoms by baseline functioning in COVID-19 cases. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315425.g002 Out of the 313 respondents who tested positive for COVID-19 and underwent cognitive battery, ADL/IADL, and CESD assessments, as well as responded to queries regarding their perception of having PCC, 38% (n = 119) reported experiencing PCC after the infection. Among the 313 respondents, 89 developed new cognitive impairment, functional limitations, and/or high depressive symptoms post-infection. Interestingly, approximately half of them (n = 49) were unaware of these emerging impairments. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that older age (OR [95% CI]: 1.07 [1.02, 1.13], p = 0.006) and fewer pre-existing health conditions prior to COVID-19 (0.72 [0.54, 0.95], p = 0.02) were associated with the lack of awareness regarding PCC. Respondents with cognitive impairment after COVID-19 infection were more likely to have fewer years of education (OR [95% CI]: 0.80 [0.72, 0.89], p<0.001) and pre-existing cognitive impairment (11.5 [4.50, 29.2], p<0.001) compared to those without (Table 2). Females (2.69 [1.13, 6.36], p = 0.03), individuals with a higher number of health conditions (1.34 [1.05, 1.70], p = 0.02), and those reporting functional limitation before COVID-19 (20.4 [8.36, 51.6], p<0.001) were more likely to have functional limitation after COVID-19 (Table 2). Pre-existing depressive symptoms (6.02 [2.60, 13.96], p<0.001) were associated with higher depressive symptoms after COVID-19 (Table 2). The number of nights in the hospital due to COVID-19 (0.84 [0.73, 0.97], p = 0.02) and total wealth over $125,000 (0.27 [0.11, 0.71], p = 0.008) were inversely associated with high depressive symptoms after COVID-19 (Table 2). Effects of demographics and number of health conditions on cognitive impairment, functional limitation, and high depressive symptoms among COVID-19 positive respondents https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315425.t002 Symptoms and disabilities between COVID-19 positive individuals versus negative Adjusting for demographic, pre-COVID-19/baseline health conditions, pre-COVID-19/baseline cognition, function, depressive symptoms, and hospitalization between 2018–2020, respondents who reported being COVID-19 positive had higher odds of any functional limitation (OR [95% CI]: 1.78 [1.26, 2.51], p = 0.001) and depressive symptoms (1.41 [1.04, 1.91], p = 0.03) compared to those who reported being COVID-19 negative. However, there was no significant association with cognitive impairment (1.11 [0.79, 1.55], p = 0.56) (see Table 3 and S2 Table in S1 File). Associations between COVID-19 infection and cognitive impairment, functional limitation, and high depressive symptoms in the crude analysis, multivariable analysis, and propensity-score matching. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315425.t003 Propensity-score matching yielded similar results (Table 3). The distribution of the estimated propensity scores for COVID-19 history in each functioning model is shown in S1 Fig in S1 File. The matched analytic sample pairs were 383, 387, and 359 in the cognitive impairment, functional limitation, and high depression symptom models, respectively. The standardized mean differences in the unmatched and matched sample are shown in S2 Fig in S1 File. Using the HRS study, we compared post-COVID-19 cognition, functional status, and depressive symptoms in 409 COVID-19-positive individuals with their pre-illness baselines, along with 8,689 uninfected individuals. Among COVID-19-positive respondents, 24% exhibited new impairments after COVID-19 infection. These new impairments included a significant decrease in functional ability and a marginal decrease in cognitive function following COVID-19 infection when compared to individuals’ pre-infection baseline. When compared to 8,689 COVID-19-negative individuals, COVID-19-positive individuals had a significant decline in functional abilities and a high prevalence of depressive symptoms. Factors associated with impairments after COVID-19 infection included pre-existing impairments, less education, female gender, lower wealth status, prior hospitalization, higher comorbidity at baseline, and experiencing mild COVID-19 infection. Many COVID-19-positive respondents experienced PCC without awareness, especially older individuals with fewer pre-existing health conditions. Previous research has focused on the prevalence of post-COVID-19 cognitive impairment through follow-up assessments without accounting for baseline cognitive function. These studies reveal that hospitalized COVID-19 patients experience significant cognitive impairment compared to non-infected controls [28–30]. Conversely, mild COVID-19 cases (non-hospitalized) do not demonstrate a significant cognitive impairment in comparison to non-infected controls [31]. This approach makes it difficult to determine the specific contribution of COVID-19 to incident cognitive impairment. After factoring in baseline cognitive functioning, our study discovered a marginal decrease in cognitive performance among COVID-19-positive respondents following infection. However, similar to the prior work, there was no significant decline in cognitive function among individuals with mild COVID-19 infection when compared to non-infected individuals. This suggests that the development of cognitive impairment after COVID-19 may be attributed to factors extending beyond the viral, encompassing variables such as level of education and pre-existing cognitive vulnerabilities. Consistent with previous studies [3, 32–36], our research confirms that individuals, regardless of hospitalization status, experience new impairments in ADL/IADL after COVID-19 infection. These impairments were consistently observed in both within-group and between-group analyses, reaffirming the negative impact of COVID-19 on functional abilities. Such increased care dependency negatively impacts the quality of life for individuals and places a burden on caregivers [37, 38]. Additionally, our study findings align with other studies [5, 31, 39–42] showing that individuals with COVID-19 have significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms compared to healthy individuals. However, our study did not find significant differences in levels of depressive symptoms before and after infection among COVID-19-positive individuals. Therefore, further investigation is needed to determine whether the increased occurrence of high levels of depressive symptoms after COVID-19 infection is a consequence of the infection or the pandemic’s social and economic impacts [5]. This consideration is particularly relevant, given that the observed total wealth exceeding $125,000 was inversely associated with high levels of depressive symptoms following COVID-19 in our study. Our findings highlight a significant discrepancy between objective measures and subjective awareness of PCC, which aligns with previous studies [6, 43–46]. Significantly, a noteworthy portion of individuals in our study displayed PCC Signs/symptoms without realizing they were experiencing PCC. This emphasizes the importance of incorporating both objective and subjective measurements to assess PCC. By integrating these approaches, we can gain a better understanding of the overall impact of COVID-19 on health. Additionally, our study indicates that age and pre-existing health conditions may influence an individual’s perception and awareness of their PCC. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the underlying factors contributing to these associations, including cognitive biases, psychological resilience, and social determinants of health. Such knowledge can help identify individuals who may be at a higher risk of underreporting or overlooking health effects after COVID-19 infection. It also enables the provision of necessary care, support, and interventions to ensure optimal recovery and well-being during the post-COVID-19 journey. Finally, our study, consistent with previous research [12, 47–49], validates that individuals with milder COVID-19 symptoms (fewer nights in the hospital), lower levels of education, female gender, previous hospitalization, higher comorbidity, and lower wealth status are at a higher risk of developing PCC after infection. This underscores the importance of identifying the diverse care needs of individuals affected by COVID-19, especially for those with milder COVID symptoms, poor baseline health, and low socioeconomic status. Our study exhibits several notable strengths. Firstly, we explore the prevalence of PCC in conjunction with its associated risk factors utilizing a nationally representative cohort. Furthermore, our analysis integrates measurements captured both prior to and subsequent to COVID-19 infection, representing an innovative approach. The robustness of our findings is additionally fortified through the utilization of both multivariable logistic regression and propensity score matching techniques. Nonetheless, our study does have several limitations. First, the HRS was not specifically designed to investigate PCC, thus commonly reported symptoms associated with PCC, such as post-exertional malaise and fatigue, were not captured. Additionally, the neuropsychological battery primarily assessed overall cognitive function, and may not have fully examined specific cognitive domains or enabled definitive clinical diagnoses. Despite employing cutoff scores associated with clinical dementia [50], our methodology may not have been sensitive enough to detect subtle or specific changes in cognitive abilities [51]. Furthermore, we excluded participants who were unable to complete the neuropsychological battery, potentially underestimating the true impact of COVID-19 on cognitive impairment. Moreover, our study primarily included individuals with mild COVID-19 infections, as only a small proportion were hospitalized. This suggests that the lack of observed cognitive impairment between COVID-19-infected and non-infected individuals in our sample may be attributed to the mild nature of the COVID-19 cases in our study population. Given that the majority of our study participants are aged 50 or older, a demographic more susceptible to various health concerns, additional research is needed to ascertain whether the noted impairments in our study are attributable to aging, other health conditions, or potential COVID-19 side effects. Within this nationally representative cohort of community-dwelling adults, 24% of COVID-19-positive respondents developed new impairments following their infection. COVID-19 infection was associated with increased odds of new functional limitation and high depressive symptoms but not cognitive impairment compared to those without COVID-19 infection. Nevertheless, among those with COVID-19 infection, declines in both functional ability and cognition were evident in comparison to their pre-COVID baselines. The varied outcomes observed in both within-person and between-person analyses of depressive symptoms suggest that the causes of post-COVID-19 depressive symptoms may extend beyond the direct effects of the virus. Psychological, social, and environmental factors may also contribute to the development of these symptoms. Therefore, further investigation is required to comprehensively understand the origins of these conditions. Additionally, comprehensive screening, encompassing both subjective and objective measures for PCC, is essential as many individuals may remain unaware of these deficits. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315425.s001 S1 Checklist.

    "full_content": "Online Safety Act Notes for Small Sites The UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA) was passed into law in 2023 and is now being implemented, with the first parts of it going into effect in March 2025. The guidance provided is rather impenetrable, so I’ve decided to write my own summary here. I’m not a lawyer and this document is not legal advice, but I am quite familiar with UK law and I’ve spent several hours reading the guidance. I’m mostly writing this to condense my own thoughts, but I hope others find it useful, and suggestions are welcome. If you’re running a service covered by the OSA, you’re going to need to carefully review the law and the guidance yourself (hopefully this’ll help), or you’ll need to get a lawyer. This document is targeted towards operators of small “user-to-user” services, with up to 700,000 UK users, and which are not “likely to be accessed by children” (as covered below). Regulated services are sometimes referred to as “Part 3” services. You might see references to “Category 1/2A/2B” services – these are the largest services which are subject to additional regulation. If you’re one of those, you’ll have the dubious honour of being contacted directly by Ofcom in summer 2025, but if you’re running a smaller service, you still have plenty of new rules to comply with. OSA compliance is a risk assessment based process, so if you’re trying to find solid answers to some questions, you may find there aren’t any. As long as you’re able to justify your answer, you’re unlikely to face an immediate fine if the regulator ever disagrees with it. I’ll try and keep this document up to date as the situation develops, but I can’t provide any guarantees. Summary of the Online Safety Act In a nutshell, the OSA requires services which handle user-generated content to: Have baseline content moderation practices Use those moderation practices to take down content that violates UK law The act itself provides a broad framework, but most of the useful detail is in the statutory guidance, which Ofcom has initially published in December 2024. That’s the “Regulatory documents & guidance” section on this page – not all the other documents above it, which are just their expansive response to the consultation. There is a second wave of guidance due to land in January 2025 which covers age verification and pornographic content. I’m trying to keep this relatively jargon-free but there are a few terms which get used constantly: : Terrorism, CSAM, grooming, assisting suicide, threats to kill, harassment, stalking, bunch of public order offences. (There’s a lot. See schedules 5-7 for the full list) communications offences defined in the OSA itself (encouraging self-harm, threatening communications, etc), or any other offence the government decides to add in future : Any content which amounts to a : Any content which amounts to a The Online Safety Act applies to every service which handles user-generated content and has “links to the UK”, with a few limited exceptions listed below. The scope is extraterritorial (like the GDPR) so even sites entirely operated outside the UK are in scope if they are considered to have “links to the UK”. A service has links to the UK if any of the following apply: the service has a “significant number” of UK users UK users form one of the target markets for the service the service is accessible to UK users and “there are reasonable grounds to believe that there is a material risk of significant harm to individuals in the UK” (this seems less likely to apply for smaller services but who knows) “Significant number” is not defined, either in the law or the guidance. Ofcom says: Service providers should be able to explain their judgement, especially if they think they do not have a significant number of UK users. (Overview of Regulated Services 1.11-1.13) There’s a short list of narrow exemptions, which are not covered by the OSA at all: Internal business services, only accessible to employees (or volunteers/contractors) Email services (it appears this includes mailing lists) SMS/MMS/one-to-one voice services “Limited functionality services” This is when users can only post comments on the provider’s published content, not on user-generated content This includes, e.g., product reviews It probably includes blog comments but it may not include them if users can reply to each other – this is unclear ( Overview of Regulated Services 1.17 Services which enable combinations of Email/SMS/limited functionality services Services provided by public bodies Services provided by persons providing education or childcare The OSA puts obligations on the service provider, so if you host a community on a platform such as Discord or WhatsApp, the OSA doesn’t directly affect you (although it’s likely you’ll soon see the indirect effects). While larger platforms are subject to more regulation under the OSA than smaller sites, I think it’s clear that it provides a centralising force, particularly given the complexity of the regulations and the lack of straightforward guidance for smaller sites. As a small user-to-user service, the OSA requires you to: Take proportionate measures to mitigate the illegal content risks you identified Take proportionate measures to prevent people encountering Take proportionate measures to mitigate the risk of people committing Allow users to easily report illegal content, and content which is harmful to children, and take it down Allow users to complain about reports, takedowns, etc “Have particular regard to the importance of protecting users’ right to freedom of expression” You don’t have to worry too much about these duties directly – the risk assessment process guides you through what you need to do to comply with them. If your service is “likely to be accessed by children” there are additional requirements, including to perform a separate “children’s risk assessment”. This document does not cover services which are likely to be accessed by children, but you must perform a “children’s access assessment” to confirm this. Your service (or part of it) is “likely to be accessed by children” if the following applies: You don’t use age verification or age estimation to prevent children from accessing it, and, There is a “significant number” of children who are users (based on the ratio of total UK users to UK child users), or it’s “likely to attract” a significant number of child users Of course “significant number” isn’t defined here either. Ofcom has a guidance page on these assessments. Notably it says: Even a relatively small number of children could be significant in terms of the risk of harm. We suggest you should err on the side of caution in making your assessment. More guidance for this will be published in January 2025 as part of “phase two”. This will definitely mandate age verification for porn sites – it seems to be unclear whether this will be required for anything else, but I think it’s a possibility. It’s worth commenting briefly on the “freedom of expression” duty. Ofcom is clear that it’s intended to prevent the OSA itself from unduly interfering with users’ freedom of expression. Sites are still free to put whatever additional restrictions they like in their TOS, and Ofcom has no power to restrict that, though it’s worth taking the opportunity to make sure that your TOS supports the moderation actions you’re taking. Ofcom does not have a power under the Act to compel providers to carry content they do not wish to carry. In practice, this means that services may continue to operate with regard to Terms and Conditions which prohibit more content than is covered in this Guidance, though they will not be compliant if their Terms and Conditions capture less. However, we encourage providers to consider carefully the impacts of their choices on users’ opportunities to express themselves. (Illegal Content Judgements Guidance 1.4) If you’re found not to be complying with the OSA, Ofcom will notify you and ask you to fix it first (a “provisional notice of contravention”). If you don’t, they have the ability to fine you up to 10% of worldwide revenue or £18m (through a “confirmation decision”). The purpose of these fines is to act as a deterrent, not to put you out of business. If a service doesn’t comply with a confirmation decision, and Ofcom believes the risk of harm is sufficiently high, they can deploy “business disruption measures”, by ordering ISPs, service providers, or app stores to block the service. If you fail to comply with a requirement in the confirmation decision, and the requirement relates to children’s online safety, you can be prosecuted (s138). Corporate officers can be made personally liable for these offences (s202). Illegal content risk assessment This is really the core part of the OSA. All services must carry out a “suitable and sufficient” illegal content risk assessment. making any significant change to your service (see Within 3 months of launching a new service (or a service coming into the scope of the OSA) Whenever Ofcom changes their guidance You need to keep records of each assessment. (s9(1-4)) The risk assessment guidance, at a mere 84 pages, is actually one of the better and more concise documents, and you probably do need to read that one all the way through. which you must individually risk-assess. You also have to assess the risk of other Each category needs to be assigned a risk level of “low”, “medium”,  or “high” The risk assessment needs to take into account the risk of encountering illegal content, taking into account any recommendation algorithms or sharing features the risk of users committing or facilitating a , and possibly harming other users in the process the nature and severity of the harm which could be caused how the service’s design might affect the risks You’ll need to refer to the “Risk Profiles” in section 1 of the guidance and list the aspects which apply to your service This is then combined with “evidence” (data about your service) to produce the final risk score. This is the fuzzy bit, although section 3 has some rules about this So now you’ve got a risk assessment, you can finally find out what you have to do. Smaller services (which again, are the only services we consider here), are split into three categories based on the results of your risk assessment. This will then determine the list of measures you need to take. Technically these are only recommended measures, and you’re not required to implement them, but if you implement these measures, you are considered to be complying with the duties. You can use your own alternative measures as long as you ensure they protect users’ freedom of speech and privacy, as well as complying with the duties. (s49) The measures are numbered (in the form “ICU A1”), and as a user-to-user service you only have to care about those starting ICU. Those measures are summarised in the “Summary of our decisions” document and described in detail in the Code of Practice for user-to-user services. I’ve only summarised them here, in a more readable format. Measures are split up by risk category. Every risk category includes the previous ones: This is the minimum standard for all services regulated by the OSA. You’re a low-risk service only if you have assessed your risk as low for all 17 kinds of illegal harms. I suspect this category might cover the smallest forums, as well as other sites which have some user-generated content. Name an individual (accountable to the most senior governance body) to handle content safety, reporting and complaints. Have a process to review content which the (not the user, that comes later) thinks may be illegal. Have systems designed to swiftly take down illegal content, unless it is currently not technically feasible to achieve this outcome. (\"Swiftly\" is not defined.) Have a system for users to make a complaint. Users should be able to complain about a specific piece of content, or just complain in general. They must be able to provide supporting information with the complaint. A user complaint about illegal content should be treated as per ICU C1. If a complaint is an appeal, it should be determined promptly. (No guidance provided on the difference between \"swiftly\" and \"promptly\".) If an appeal is approved, the content or user subject to that appeal should be reinstated. If there's a pattern of content being taken down in error, guidance should be adjusted or automated systems should be changed. If the complaint is about \"proactive technology\" (scanning/fingerprinting) not behaving correctly, the complainant should be told what the provider is doing to rectify it, and their right to take legal action (?) If the complaint is about compliance with the OSA, it should be passed to a nominated individual, and should be handled within an appropriate timeframe. A complaint should only be disregarded if it is manifestly unfounded, in accordance with the TOS. These events should be reviewed to ensure the policy is appropriate. The provider's TOS must include a number of specified provisions regarding illegal content, proactive technology, and complaints. The terms from ICU G1 must be clearly signposted, accessible, and easily readable for the age range of the site. The provider must remove public content and accounts from proscribed terrorist organisations. Single-risk services are services where only one harm is assessed as being “medium” or “high” risk. In addition to the measures in the low-risk services category, single-risk services are recommended to: High risk of image-based CSAM & is a file-storage/file-sharing service Use perceptual hashing to scan uploaded images for CSAM. Acknowledge receipt of each complaint and provide an indicative timeframe for deciding the complaint Enable the complainant to opt out of receiving any non-ephemeral (?) communications about a complaint. High risk of grooming & existing means to determine the age/age range of the user Hide child user accounts from recommended follows, disallow direct messaging to child accounts the user does not follow. Prompt child user accounts with contextual info about safety features and risks. (Note that there are several measures omitted from this table which only apply to services “likely to be accessed by children”, and ICU C9 also applies to all sites with >700k users. Both of which are currently out of the scope of this document.) Multi-risk services are all other services, where more than one risk is “medium” or “high”. Have written statements of responsibilities regarding illegal harms for senior managers. Track evidence of new kinds of illegal content, using data from complaints/moderation/law enforcement referrals/etc. Have a code of conduct for employees around illegal harms. Employees working in design and management of the service must be trained in compliance to safety duties. Written internal content policies. Content moderation performance targets covering speed and accuracy. Written policy for prioritising content for review. Content moderation should be adequately resourced. Content moderators should receive adequate training and materials. Content moderation volunteers should have access to adequate materials. Appeal processing should be monitored for speed and accuracy and adequately resourced. Recommender systems are tested publicly & high risk of two or more harms from a specific list Safety metrics should be produced and analysed when conducting on-platform testing of recommender systems. In their consultation response, Ofcom makes clear that they don’t intend for the Online Safety Act to make decentralised services unlawful: We recognise that a wide variety of service types will fall in scope of the Act, including services with a decentralised and community-moderated organisational model. However, we have intentionally designed each measure with flexibility in mind as we recognise the importance for providers to have some flexibility in how they will implement these measures. We encourage providers to consider the safety outcome expected and to implement the measures in a way that is appropriate and effective for their own service and organisational structure. (Volume 1: Governance and Risk Management 5.19) Given that the duties only require services to take “proportionate measures”, the implication must be that decentralised services will be given more leeway. Fediverse services like Mastodon should be able to re-use a standardised risk assessment, which should simplify things. However, they will likely end up in the “multi-risk” category, and some of the recommended measures don’t apply neatly to this situation, which means you may not get the guarantee of compliance which those measures provide. Age verification (guidance coming January 2025) may also be an issue here. I hear IFTAS may be working on some Online Safety Act guidance for Fediverse services, so I’d stay tuned and don’t panic too much (yet). The most interesting question here is: if your Mastodon server doesn’t have “links to the UK”, but it federates with servers which do, are you subject to the OSA? To comment on this post, mention me on mastodon, or drop me an email."
